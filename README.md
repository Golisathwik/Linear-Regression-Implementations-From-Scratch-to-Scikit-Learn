# Linear-Regression-Implementations-From-Scratch-to-Scikit-Learn
This repository contains three distinct approaches to building a Linear Regression model. Linear Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used to quantify the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and an independent variable (X), allowing us to make predictions based on that relationship.
